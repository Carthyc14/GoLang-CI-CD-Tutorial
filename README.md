# GoLang CI-CD Tutorial

## Introduction

This lab was original written on GitLab by RZFeeser.  

See [https://gitlab.com/rzfeeser/golang-ci-cd-tutorial](https://gitlab.com/rzfeeser/golang-ci-cd-tutorial)

The overall purpose is experimenting with using Go within GitLab's CI / CD pipelines. 


## Getting Started

The `.github/workflow/go.yml` file in this repository will cause automation to run tests against the code within. If tests are passed, the application will be run as well.
